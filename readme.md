# gRPC Communication Modes Exploration

This repository is dedicated to exploring the different communication modes in gRPC, namely Unary, Server Stream, Client Stream, and Bidirectional Stream.

## Introduction

gRPC is a powerful framework for building efficient and distributed systems. It offers various communication patterns to cater to diverse application needs.

## Communication Modes Explored

### Unary
Unary RPC is a simple request-response mechanism. The client sends a single request and receives a single response from the server. It's suitable for low-latency operations.

### Server Stream
In Server Stream RPC, the client sends a request to the server and receives a stream of responses. This is useful for scenarios where the server sends multiple related results.

### Client Stream
Client Stream RPC allows the client to send a stream of requests to the server and receives a single response. It's efficient for cases with large data sets.

### Bidirectional Stream
Bidirectional Stream RPC enables both the client and server to send streams of messages concurrently. This mode is beneficial for interactive applications.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Explore each communication mode in its respective folder.
3. Run the provided examples to see these modes in action.
4. Learn, experiment, and adapt the patterns to your projects.
